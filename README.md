# Software Engineering interview question and answer with example problems

My name is Senthil Ramachandran and I am a software engineering having 13 years of experince.

I can be reached at 786.senthil@gmail.com

Please provide your suggestion to make this document very useful.

#### I have consider the following facts while preparting this document
1. You are expecting an interview soon and you want to cover the most of the important topic as early as possible.
2. Candidate have some basic computer science fundamental knowledge.
3. Speding more than 10 mins on each topic will not be worth if you have tight deadline.
4. Need single source of document for an interview, referrencing multiple website require considrable amount of time and efforts. 
5. Each topic required some interview questions and answers. 

Note:- Clicking on each link will navigate us to detail page which contains source code using C# and problem you may encounter during interview


This Github repository will covers most of the software engineering interview  question and answers , also reference for the questions <b> (leetcode, geeksforgeeks,hackerrank,hackerearth, youtupe etc).</b> , any one have good understanding of object oriented programming  can able to understand the code. I started documenting all together and provide the single source for an interview preparation. This will not cover 100% interview problem but it will help us to understand all the important topics and it covers some overview of Data Structure and Algorithm, Design Pattern, OOPS, Object Oriented design for a realtime problem, DBMS (SQL and NOSQL), Network, Problem Solving and System Design. I will keep update this repostory as I learn. Basic understading of programming language is require to understand the code.

Suggestions and comments are welcome.

  <h5>Why do we need data structures? </h5>
Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing information in a computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.

#### Data structures are important for the following reasons:

1. Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.
2. Each Data Structure allows data to be stored in specific manner.
3. Data Structure allows efficient data search and retrieval.
4. Specific Data structures are decided to work for specific problems.

    - Data structure: Method to store information
    - Algorithm: Method for solving a problem.


  - <b>Time complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
  - <b>Space complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.<br/><br>
    
         - Algorithm complexity is commonly represented with the O(n) notation, - also known as asymptotic 
         notation or “Big O notation”, where n is the function of the size of the input data. 
         We need to know how well our algorithm perform in  Best Case, Average Case and Worst Case 
         
 #### Most improtant complexity 
   - O(n) Linear time find a value in an array 
   - O(nlogn) Quick Sort
   - (2<sup>n</sup>) Factorial 
   - O(logn) - Binary Search

Most interviewers won't ask about specific algorithms for binary tree balancing or other complex algorithms and 
 You're usually only expected to know the basics</font>
 
## Data Structure
- [Array](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Array) 
    - An array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index.
- [Linked List](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/LinkedList) 
   - A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.
- ArrayList 
   - It is similar to an array, except that it grows automatically as you add items in it. Unlike an array, you don't need to specify the size of ArrayList.
- [Trees](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Trees) -> Tree, [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/blob/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Trees/README.MD#binarytree), [Binary Tree](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/blob/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Trees/README.MD#binarytree).
   - A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges.
- [Tries](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Trie) 
   - Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure.
- [Graph](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/GraphAlgorithm) 
   - A graph is a data structure where a node can have zero or more adjacent elements.
- [Stack](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Stack) 
   - Stack is a linear data structure which represents a simple last-in-first-out (LIFO) 
- [Queue](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/tree/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Queue) 
   - Queue is a linear data structure which represents a simple first-in-first-out (FIFO) 
- [Heap](https://github.com/senthil338/coding_interview/blob/master/CodingPractice/CodingPractice/DataStructure/Heap/README.MD) 
   - A Heap or Binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property.
- [HashTable or Dictionary] 
   - A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs, and retrive value by passing key

## Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Tree Traversal
- Merge Sort
- QuickSort
- Insertion sort, Selection sort, Bubble sort. (just to let you know)
- Binary Search
- Dijkstra

 
Most of the time we hear the term called Greed and Naive/Brute-force  Algorithm
I don't want to explain more depth but it's very useful to know the term as we go indepth we hear this work more offten </br></br>
<b>Greed algorithm :</b> Greedy algorithm is one which finds the feasible solution at every stage with the hope of finding global optimum solution.
</br><b>Brute-force Algorithms :</b> Solves a problem in the most simple, direct, or obvious way.
