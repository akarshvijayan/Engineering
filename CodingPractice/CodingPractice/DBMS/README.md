#### Below are some of the features of NoSQL:
**1.Flexibility:** NoSQL offers flexibility to store structured, semi-structured or unstructured data, unlike a relational database which allows only structured data.   

**2. Dynamic Schemas:** In NoSQL schema definition is not required, this solves the problem to modify the schema where a table is already present with huge datasets and new columns need to be added to the same table.   

**3.Sharding:** Sharding means partitioning data into smaller databases to have faster access to data. This feature is present in NoSQL databases which allow us to fetch data from a server in fastest time.   

**4.Generic:** NoSQL database can be customized by the user as per the need.   

**5.Scaling:** NoSQL databases scale out horizontally thus, they are cheaper to manage.
