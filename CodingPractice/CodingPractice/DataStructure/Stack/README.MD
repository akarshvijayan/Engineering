# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed
Its represents a simple last-in-first-out (LIFO).

#### Basic operation on Stack

Search Time : - O(n), Push :- O(1), Pop :- O(1), Peek :- 0(1)
Space : O(n)

   - Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
   - Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed
   - Peek Returns the top item from the stack.
