# Queue

Queue stores the elements in FIFO style (First In First Out), exactly opposite of the Stack collection. It contains the elements in the order they were added.

#### Basic Operation 
   - Enqueue	Adds an item into the queue O(1)
   - Dequeue	Removes and returns an item from the beginning of the queue O(1)
   - Peek	Returns an first item from the queue O(1)
