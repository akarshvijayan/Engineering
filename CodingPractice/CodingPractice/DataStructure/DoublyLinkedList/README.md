Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list in which a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the 
sequence. Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) , 
pointer to the previous node (previous pointer). A sample node in a doubly linked list is shown in the figure.
